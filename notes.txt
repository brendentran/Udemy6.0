Functions:
	We've used a quite a few functions so far.
	We've also talked briefly about arugments and parameters. We saw one 
	function we've used a lot, is the print function.
	We'll also learn about return values from functions
	It's much easier to debug small pieces of code

Parameters:
	Parameters are like place holders for the real values that you'll pass to 
	your function. They're just variations

Palindrome Function Challenge:
    Fix our is_palindrome function so that it ignores the case of the letters, when checking if the two strings are equal.
    answer is .casefold() which changes the input to all lowercase or all uppercase
